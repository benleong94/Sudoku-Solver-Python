# Requirements and Risk Log

* The project codes shall be written in Python.

* We expected to use GitHub for code version control and collaboration, Jira for team project management.

* All team members are expected to play the roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner at least once throughout the project. Our team is expected to hold regular stakeholder review meetings and scrum ceremonies including stand-up meetings, sprint retrospective and sprint planning.

* The Game Level Generator will create a new Sudoku grid based on the number of tries, the number of errors and the time taken to solve the previous grid. The user can choose if the new grid should be easier or harder. It shall generate a screen display of the grid, and a recommended solution to solve the Sudoku grid. 

* The Smart Game Solver will read the Sudoku grid and complete the level in the most effective and efficient way. After which, it will make a comparison of its solution and the Game Level Generatorâ€™s solution using 3 indicators - number of tries, number of errors and time taken. After which, it will produce an analytical report. The analytical report shall provide recommendations for how the Game Level Generator can generate a new level using the given indicators. The user can choose if the new level will be more difficult or easier.

* The story was assigned to all of us, and its was completed.


Functional requirements: 

Use-case #1
1. Title: Solving algorithm	
2. Primary Actor: Game level generator (GLG)
3. Story:The game level generator should be able to use the solving algorithm to solve the sudoku grid. 

Use-case #2
1. Title: Algorithm analysis 
2. Primary Actor: Smart game solver (SGS)
3. Story: The SGS should be able to generate an analytics report of the sudoku algorithms and use the data to provide recommendations for a new level

Use-case #3
1. Use-case title: Difficulty selection
2. Primary Actor: User
3. Story: The user should be able to select the difficulty of the next level, so that the GLG can generate the new grid. 

## Risk Log

Time

* As a working adults part time student, time risk are the challenge we facing. A well time management is important and need to be implemented for us to achieve a 
life balance between our family, career and study. The requirement to form a well time management includes, prepare a to do list, deadline and finish the project within the timeline we set. 

Manpower

* We occasionally encounter staffing constraints during job allocation or meetings, and this is because some of the team members work shift jobs. The impact of the staffing risk was minimized by conducting a team meeting after work or during weekends. The team member unable to attend the meeting will be given updates on project progress using social media applications like Whatapps.

Client/project requirements

* It's a difficult challenge for the project team to understand what the client needs, and it takes us longer time to extract more product information. Sometimes can even lead to client frustration due to the product, not meeting client requirements. To accomplish client demands and bring the project to its goals. The project team needs to be very tedious in listening to the client and listing down the point and requirements need in formal to fulfill their requirements.

Health and safety

* The ongoing Covid19 pandemic restricts our team meetings from being conducted face-to-face externally. One of our members was infected by covid around sprint 2, which led to canceling our planned gatherings, mainly because of infection risk. We mitigated this by conducting meetings online.
