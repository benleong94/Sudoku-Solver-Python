# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

*Include a paragraph or two, agreed by all team members, on how well the group has worked together, and how well the project is progressing.*

*Discuss the scrum meetings, and what could make them more efficient (if anything).*

*Highlight any communication issues that might be affecting the project.*

*If standup meetings were used, then include a Jira link, and discuss their effectiveness.*

Overall, we have managed to assimilate well and work together in a team effectviely. 

Overall, we have managed to assimilate well and work together in a team effectviely. We keep track of our progress on a weekly basis 
mostly. We are all full-time working adults with other personal and family commitments. We had to learn how to manage our time effectively 
and coordinate with each other in order to get work done.

We had some physical meetings as well as online meetings to discuss the project. We then proceeded to split the work and we work in teams of 2. 
We realized that such an arrangement (of working in pairs) works well for us. 

For better communication, we used mostly Whatsapp and MS Teams to coordinate our work. We ensured that our ideas were communicated properly and 
ask each other questions to get clarification. This helped to prevent any misunderstanding, to prevent any communication issues.

## Sprint Burndown Charts

*In this section include a screenshot of a sprint-burndown chart for each of your completed sprints.*

*For each sprint, include links to the standup meetings (recorded on Jira, hopefully) associated with each sprint.*

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
*Add a discussion of what the burndown charts indicate, and how your team might improve their velocity / estimation ability in future sprints.

The burn-down charts show how many tasks are completed in the sprints and how much work remains. We can improve our velocity in future sprints by clarifying tasks and providing a reasonable time estimate.

## Product Backlog
*Include here a screenshot of your current product backlog.*

## Other Areas
*If your team has anything else they want to demonstrate, e.g. advanced project management tools, reporting graphs with suitable explanation and interpretation, advanced use of Jira (e.g. issue links, epics, versions), or continuous integration tools, then include a summary here.*
