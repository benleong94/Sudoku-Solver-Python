# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

* Overall, we have managed to assimilate well and work together in a team effectviely. We keep track of our progress on a weekly basis 
mostly. We are all full-time working adults with other personal and family commitments. We had to learn how to manage our time effectively 
and coordinate with each other in order to get work done.

* We had some physical meetings as well as online meetings to discuss the project. We then proceeded to split the work and we work in teams of 2. 
We realized that such an arrangement (of working in pairs) works well for us. 

* During scrum meetings, we always had a scrum master and a product owner. We rotated the roles every week so that everyone could
play different roles.

* For better communication, we used mostly Whatsapp and MS Teams to coordinate our work. We ensured that our ideas were communicated properly and 
ask each other questions to get clarification. This helped to prevent any misunderstanding, to prevent any communication issues.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

* The burn-down charts show how many tasks are completed in the sprints and how much work remains. We can improve our velocity in future sprints by clarifying tasks and providing a reasonable time estimate.
