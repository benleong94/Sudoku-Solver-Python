* Its quite hard to estimate the total size and percent share of the market of sudoku games in Singapore, as the game is relatively new compared to other puzzles such as crossword and word search puzzles. The fact that the game doesn't require any mathematical and wording ability makes it highly popular among leisure players, which raises the demand for its supply of more complex levels as the user can finish each puzzle in a short time. There is also demand from hardcore players who want to explore new or alternative solving techniques besides the old backtracking method.

# Competition

* The other products on the market are Sudoku solvers. They simply accept a Sudoku grid, solve it with an algorithm and display the answer. Our product differs from them in a few ways. Firstly, our program can analyze algorithms by calculating the number of tries, errors and time taken to solve the Sudoku grid. Secondly, it can provides a report that compares between different algorithms. Thirdly, it can generate a new Sudoku level based on given parameters, and allows the user to choose an easier or harder Sudoku grid,
