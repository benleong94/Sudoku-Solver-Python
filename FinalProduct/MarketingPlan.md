# Marketing Plan

# Customers

* Our product's target audiences are those leisure players who are ages 13 and up, both male and female, regardless of ethnicity or religion, and anyone who is IT literate and has an interest in solving Sudoku puzzles. The group would mainly consist of students or retired elderly who have more time and would like to keep their minds sharp by solving puzzles. Income level would not be applicable since this is a readily available free product. We aim to capture the Singapore market. (age, gender, ethnicity, religion, level of education, occupation, income)

# Economics

* Its quite hard to estimate the total size and percent share of the market of sudoku games in Singapore, as the game is relatively new compared to other puzzles such as crossword and word search puzzles. The fact that the game doesn't require any mathematical and wording ability makes it highly popular among leisure players, which raises the demand for its supply of more complex levels as the user can finish each puzzle in a short time. There is also demand from hardcore players who want to explore new or alternative solving techniques besides the old backtracking method.

# Competition

* The other products on the market are Sudoku solvers. They simply accept a Sudoku grid, solve it with an algorithm and display the answer. Our product differs from them in a few ways. Firstly, our program can analyze algorithms by calculating the number of tries, errors and time taken to solve the Sudoku grid. Secondly, it can provides a report that compares between different algorithms. Thirdly, it can generate a new Sudoku level based on given parameters, and allows the user to choose an easier or harder Sudoku grid, 

# Product, Price, Promotion, Place

* For Promotion, we would be adopting the online and word-of-mouth advertising method as it helps us reach a wider audience and tell the market about our product. Our vast number of levels generated using the game level generator and effective game-solving method would attract Sudoku players to try on our product, leading to discussion among them.

* For Place, the distribution of our product is mainly done online by application listing in Apple Store and Google's Playstore, this greatly reduced the cost 

# Sales Forecast
* We estimate a minimum of 500k downloads in the first 12 months upon release into the Apple store or Google's Playstore. A substantial revenue will be gained from the advertisement in-game after deducting the program license or application listing cost, promoting costs, and game/server maintenance cost.
