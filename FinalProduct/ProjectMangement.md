# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

* Generally, we managed to assimilate well and work together in a team effectviely. As most of us are new to Agile methodology, we needed some time before becoming more familiar with how to run the scrum meetings. 

* During the first two scrum meetings, we were unsure with the differences between the scrum review and sprint retrospective. As such, we focused most of our attention on the product, and less on how well we were working together. However, as the project continued, we realized the importance of the scrum retrospective, as it helped our group communicate and coordinate better. 

* As we proceeded through the various sprints, there were issues that surfaced which required resolution.

* During the first sprint, we discovered that not everyone was 100% clear about the requirements of the product after the sprint planning. Hence, some of the user stories not being completed correctly and we had to bring forward most of the user stories to the following sprint. This slowed our velocity significantly. As such, for the second sprint planning, we made sure that everyone was clear on the product requirements before starting the sprint. 

* As we started the programming aspect of our product, we learnt that there were differences in the levels of programming skill among our group members. This affected the velocity of the project as some tasks were outside the abilities of some group members. We resolved this by changing the way we allocated the work. For example, tasks that required more programming were taken by members who are better at programming, while the others focused on other tasks like report writing. Also, we started working in pairs and we realized that such an arrangement helps us to complete the tasks better. 

* As we are all full-time working adults with other personal and family commitments, we had to learn how to manage our time effectively and coordinate with each other in order to get work done. We had some physical meetings as well as online meetings to discuss the project. For better communication, we used mostly Whatsapp and MS Teams to coordinate our work. 

## Sprint Burndown Charts
* Sprint 1
* Sprint 1 showing no user stories at all, because we are trying to familiarise with the Jira and Github.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

* The burn-down charts show how many tasks are completed in the sprints and how much work remains. We can improve our velocity in future sprints by clarifying tasks and providing a reasonable time estimate.
