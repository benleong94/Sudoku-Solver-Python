# Team Effort Log

## Kong Chee Wee

### Sprint 1 (week 2) :
* Try to understand the goals of the project and checking on youtube's tutorial video to familize with Jira and Github.
* Discuss among team members and decide which game product we choose for the project. 

### Sprint 2 (week 3) :
* Assigned by scrum master to do coding on the Smart Game Solver, partner with Yong Kiong.
* Research on internet for alternative yet faster algorithms to solve the Sudoku grid. 

### Sprint 3 (week 4):
* Testing on solving Sudoku level using the optimized backtracking algorithm. The algorithm is efficient compared to the traditional backtracking method, and we decided to use the algorithm as our Smart Game Solver's algorithm.

### Sprint 4 (week 4) :
* Assigned by scrum master to do coding on the user interface by inserting "Solve Puzzle!" button on the game's front page. 
* Volunteered to help prepare MVP documents, primarily on Team Effort Log.

### Sprint 5 (week 5) :
* Discussion among team members on improving the product after gaining feedback from the client.
* Help to prepare final product documentation and presentation slide.

## Chio Yong Kong

### Sprint 1 (week 2) :
* Confused with the project's requirement, I firstly thought of creating a game only, corrected by team members after discussion. Familiarizing with Jira only, as I already know how to use Github.
* Discuss among team members and decide which game product we choose for the project.  

### Sprint 2 (week 3) :
* Assigned by scrum master to do coding on the Smart Game Solver, partner with Chee Wee.
* Research on internet for alternative yet faster algorithms to solve the Sudoku grid. 

### Sprint 3 (week 4):
* Testing on solving Sudoku level using the simple algorithm, the algorithm is not fast enough compared to the traditional backtracking method. We keep it for alternative's algorithm.

### Sprint 4 (week 4) :
* Assigned by scrum master to do coding on the user interface by inserting "Easier" or "Harder" button after the game analytic report. 
* Volunteered to help prepare MVP documents, primarily on Requirements And Risk Log.

### Sprint 5 (week 5) :
* Discussion among team members on improving the product after gaining feedback from the client.
* Help to prepare final product documentation and presentation slide.

## Benjamin Leong Jia Juin

### Sprint 1 (week 2) :
* Try to visualize the final output of the project and testing the features of Jira and Github.
* Discuss among team members and decide which game product we choose for the project.
* Create Jira and Github repository and invite all team members to join in.

### Sprint 2 (week 3) :
* Assigned by myself to do coding on Game Level Generator, partner with Nelson. 
* Coding on solving the Sudoku Grid using traditional backtracking method.

### Sprint 3 (week 4):
* Done coding for the screen display of the Sudoku grid and implemented the backtracking solving algorithm. 
* Testing and debugging session for the GLG.

### Sprint 4 (week 4) :
* Assigned by scrum master to do coding on game difficulty selection's algorithm. 
* Volunteered to help prepare MVP documents, primarily on Product Demonstration.

### Sprint 5 (week 5) :
* Discussion among team members on improving the product after gaining feedback from the client.
* Help to prepare final product documentation and presentation slide.
