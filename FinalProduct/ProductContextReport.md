# Product Context

*Include the three sections headed below.*

## Legal

*Consider the legal issues of your product.  For example, which data was used from whom, and under what licence permissions?*
*Similarly, for any 3rd party software libraries you've used.  Acknowledge if you have full permission or not.*
*Also, what licence would be most suitable for your own software to be released under?*
*Which data protection laws are relevant to your product or future customers of your product?*

We would release our product under the GNU GPL (General Public License) - This Licence allows the 4 freedoms (elaborated under Ethical), and stipulates that any derivative of this software must retain these same rights.

GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program - to make sure it remains free software for all its users. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) uses the GNU General Public License for most of their software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. We can apply it to our program too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. The General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, FSF had designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, FSF stands ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.


## Ethical
Consider any ethical issues that have arisen or are associated with your product.

We should refer to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) views of Ethical Computing.

For our Sudoku software to be ethical, it should not control the consumers in any way.
“Free Software” is defined to be software that grants the user 4 fundamental freedoms:
1. The freedom to run the program as they wish, for any purpose
2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does their computing as they wish.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so that they can help others.
4. The freedom to distribute copies of their modified versions to others.

Data Protection Act 1998

## Health and Safety
Consider any H&S issues that have arisen or are associated with your product. 

The Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 place specific requirements on employers with the aim of protecting workers from the health risks associated with DSE. These duties also apply to the self-employed. 

These provisions would mostly apply to our staff, particularly our Sudoku developers. We emphasize that these provisons do not extend to our consumers. Consumers would have to exercise their own judgement and self-responsibility to prevent excesive use of our product, which may result in detrimental health problems. 

Display Screen Equipment means any alphanumeric or graphic display screen, regardless of the display process involved. It covers PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones as well as other methods of displaying data, such as CCTV screens.

A 'user' or 'operator' is a worker or self-employed person who uses display screen equipment as a significant part of their normal work. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) specify that it applies to 'workers who use DSE daily, for an hour or more at a time not infrequent users or short-term use'.

Eye tests
Eyesight tests and corrective eyewear must be provided, by the employer, free of charge if required. A test should be carried out by an ophthalmic optician if a DSE user requests it. Employers can offer vision screening tests, but they cannot prevent a user opting for a full eyesight test instead. Where the test shows the need for corrective eyewear specifically for DSE use and to comply with the regulations, the employer must fund the basic cost.

Training
Training and information must be provided to users and operators, explaining the risks of DSE use and how to arrange the workstation safely. It should also cover what to do if the user develops any work-related health problems.

Regular breaks
Breaks aim to avoid risks of postural fatigue by introducing periodic short breaks or changes of activity away from the DSE.
