On starting the program, the Game Level Generator is launched and it will generate a grid, which is the data file. The user can proceed to click "solve puzzle" to execute the algorithm to solve the puzzle. 

## Picture 2:

The default algorithm, which is the recommended solution, will  proceed to solve the sudoku puzzle. The algorithm is analyzed using three indicators - number of tries, errors and time taken are shown. The user can proceed to click on "Smart Game Solver" to launch the Smart Game Solver (SGS), which will provide a more efficient algorithm to solve the puzzle.

The SGS reads the data file (Sudoku grid) and solves it with a more efficient method. In the same way, it analyzes the algorithm with the same indicators as shown. The user can proceed to click on "Analytics Report".

Once clicked, the SGS generates analytics report that compares the two algorithms that were used to solve the puzzle. The user can proceed to generate a new grid.

There is an option to generate an "easier" or "harder" grid. When either one is selected, the SGS will use the indicators to generate a new puzzle. It will do that by taking the indicators of faster algorithm, run it through a calculation process that will produce a certain values. These values will be used to select an "easier" or "harder" grid from a list of grids.

The values are delivered back to the GLG, which will generate a new puzzle based on the user's selection.
