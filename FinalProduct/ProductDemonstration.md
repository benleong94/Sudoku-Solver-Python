# Product Demonstration Report

*This section should contain a brief description and demo of product you have built.*

* *Include screenshots (actual screenshots, not mock ups) of all of the facets of the product working.*
* *Link consecutive screenshots together with a brief narrative explaining how the product works, e.g. a sentence "Click on OK and it takes you to the next window", "On starting the app, the following window is shown".  This document should not take you a long time to create - it's just pasting photos and adding explanatory sentences between them, so that your MVP is adequately described.*
* *Make sure an image of each window of your software is included - so that a person who has not seen the actual demo of the product has a good idea of what your product currently does.*
* *If your product is a physical device (a hardware product) then you may replace all of the above screenshots by actual photos/vidoes where you feel it is appropriate.*
* *Make sure this section includes any functionality/features you are particularly proud of.*
* *Indicate clearly which parts of the functionality shown in the screenshots are currently incomplete, and what is likely to change in the final version.  For example if a graph displayed is currently based on static hard-coded data for the MVP, but in the future version the graph will dynamically change depending on fresh data, then point this out explicitly.*

Picture 1:
On starting the program, the Game Level Generator is launched and it will generate a grid, which is the data file. The user can proceed to click "solve puzzle" to execute the algorithm to solve the puzzle. 

Picture 2:
The default algorithm, which is the recommended solution, will  proceed to solve the sudoku puzzle. The algorithm is analyzed using three indicators - number of tries, errors and time taken are shown. The user can proceed to click on "Smart Game Solver" to launch the Smart Game Solver (SGS), which will provide a more efficient algorithm to solve the puzzle.

Picture 3:
The SGS reads the data file (Sudoku grid) and solves it with a more efficient method. In the same way, it analyzes the algorithm with the same indicators as shown. The user can proceed to click on "Analytics Report".

Picture 4:
Once clicked, the SGS generates analytics report that compares the two algorithms that were used to solve the puzzle. The user can proceed to generate a new grid. 

Picture 5:
There is an option to generate an "easier" or "harder" grid. When either one is selected, the SGS will use the indicators to generate a new puzzle. It will do that by taking the indicators of faster algorithm, run it through a calculation process that will produce a certain values. These values will be used to select an "easier" or "harder" grid from a list of grids. 

Picture 6: 
The values are delivered back to the GLG, which will generate a new puzzle based on the user's selection.
